#After the triggers are set, we need to setup the Authorizer for user registration.
#There is no user data in the DB to compare it with nor can we setup the user manually 
#Login to the ADMIN <auth.url>/dashboard
#Setup the SMTP server
Once the server is set, The IDEA is 
1. first time users will use the sign-up / admins can do that, which requires 
    an otp or verification mail
2. for resetting the authorizer password since there will be no need to reset the vtiger password.
